past &amp; current projects by your's truly. I am a UX and UI designer that loves to pretend to be a front-end developer. Mainly out of necessity. Developers are not always available and I cannot always afford to contract out. 

I am confident in my HTML and CSS. While I am still getting my JS skills up to conversational so to speak. I definitely understand the foundation and logics. Now working on recalling the syntax while I code my front end and design experiences and interactions. 

I like feedback. Receive criticism well. Enjoy having my design decisions challenged so that I can provide context and perspective. While at the same time being open to learning and bettering my skills and over all approach. 

That is it for now. 
Best, 
TRL
